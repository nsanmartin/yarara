This program is for drawing polygons in the screen. Right now it just
draw arbitrary triangles, but from this is easy to draw arbitrary
convex polygons. Maybe this could led to simple and non simple
polygons.

Once launched it shows a red screen, and after pressing 's', it will
show a triangle that could be moved (with the arrows) and rotated
(with r or R). Press Esc to return to the red screen and q to exit.



Test it in Ubuntu/Debian:

$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0 libsdl2-dev
$ make
$ ./build/cuadrado
